# FINAL

These files are a (mostly disorganized) collection of files that I used for my final project at The Iron Yard.
I created a predictive model that will determine electrical grid demand based on weather data.

I intend to clean it up eventually, to make it a bit more transparent. 
As I worked on the project, this repo became a bit of a dumping ground.
